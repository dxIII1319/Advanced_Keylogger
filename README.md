# Advanced_Keylogger

This is a basic keylogger implemented in C++. I is made for the windows subsystem. I operates in stealth/ without any prompt and would capture all the keystrokes of the target system. It also attempts to send an encrypted version of the keylogs to the attacker via mail. This project utilizes advanced concepts of C++ like namespaces, object oriented programming and more.
